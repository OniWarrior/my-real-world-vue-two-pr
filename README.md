# my-real-world-vue-two-pr
This is my first Vue project. This project comes from the Vue 2 beginner course from Vue Master


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lesson One- Router Basics 
Create three views-> EventShow, EventList,EventCreate.
These were just skeletons, there wasn't any content except a title.
Used Vue router to create paths and names for these views and added links to them in the app component of the example application.

Lesson Two- Dynamic Routing
This lesson was about abstracting away hard coded paths and have routes update dynamically.
I binded the router link paths to the path name of the path objects in vue router. This allows the path to update dynamically without having to hard code
a path to router link.
